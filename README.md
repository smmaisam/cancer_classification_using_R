# Gene Expression, Invasive and Non-Invasive Cancer Classification Using R

### SUMMARY:
This project leverages gene expression data to explore the differences between invasive and noninvasive cancer, employing advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze patterns, identify biomarkers and classify each case accurately.

- It beigns with data pre-processing, including cleaning, calculating the statistical measures followed by descriptive statistics to understand the distribution and variability of gene expressions. 
- We then conducted variance analysis to identify highly variable genes and applied principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and highlight key patterns. 
- Further, different unsupervised and supervised machine learning models were used to examine the differences between invasive and noninvasive cancer samples for classification.   
- Findings aim to contribute to the understanding of cancer biology and aid in the identification of gene signatures that differentiate invasive from noninvasive cancer types,
  potentially guiding future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
